# Java_RMS_Calculator
Program written to extract integers from a text file, and then utilise them to calculate the root mean square (RMS) value. These integers can be hidden between words/letters, or on their own. 
## Testing the Program
 - The text file that is used to test the code is called "input.txt"
 - The program will automatically create a file called "output.txt"
 - "output.txt" will contain the calculated RMS value
 - The RMS value for "input.txt" should be: 7.9686885 (approximately)
